Over my 9 years's professional career, I have been carried out different roles such as sofeware developer, data analyst, bussiness analyst and project manager. In addition, I have worked in sofeware, pharmaceutical and financial industries. My skill set is throught the whole process of SDLC, from front-end to back-end. Thus I can handle differnet projects and different roles in the industry.

The common thing that brings my teammates and I together is coffee, we all enjoy coffee a lot.

Carmen, she is from Hong Kong, China, one interesting fact about her is that she likes drawing and design. The reason why she chose MCDA program is she would like to enhance her technical skills and the internship opportunities in this program allow her to gain working experiences and build up the network in Canada.

Me, Weilin(William), one interesting fact about me is I like walking instead of taking bus and driving, but it is not that easy in North America so I have to drive.The reason why i chose MCDA program is because I like the program structure, it covers all the skills we might need in the industry and even have the co-op terms. Also, I can learn from everyone in our cohort because everyone has several years' industry experience in different domains. I believe that's gonna help me a lot in the future job market.
